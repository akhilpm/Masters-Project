KPCA with tree based feature selection
-----------------------------------------------------
Kernel based feature learning is done using Arc-cosine kernels & the feature selection
between alternate layers of the kernel is performed with tree based learning algorithms. Decision trees, randomized decision trees & random forest algorithms are studied as candidates for ranking features.

A threshold is set by cross validation to determine the relevancy of features for the classification task.
